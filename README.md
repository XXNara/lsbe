This project contains all the solutions to the problems in the book Learn SAS by Example. The book is written by Ron Cody. Here're the official link and the purchase links:

It's the most porper book for beginners to learn SAS by themselves. I'm also a SAS learner. 
There are about 10 to 20 problems in every chapter.
